[00:01.94] The sun shines much different from here
[00:08.08] Oh, the places and names so unclear
[00:13.46] Can't quite get over the fact you're so distant from me
[00:19.96] Open air, far off lands with an ocean between
[00:26.33] 12065 away
[00:31.75] In the dream while you're starting your day
[00:36.95] How does it feel all alone with that hole in your bed
[00:43.80] Making shapes with your body
[00:47.16] In the space that I left
[00:59.16] 
[00:50.58] I—I've been gone for too long
[00:55.82] On my mind, you hit me so strong
[01:00.88] All of these nights feel so long
[01:06.25] But I stay in this state
[01:11.01] Of 12065 away
[01:17.51] 
[01:26.94] I wish I could take you around
[01:30.42] To see what I've been seeing
[01:32.98] Been hearing your voice in the sounds
[01:36.79] But I know they just ain't you
[01:40.10] Nothing quite fills the void that I'd been missin'
[01:44.70] And these feelings have conviction, they do, oh
[02:08.20] 
[01:50.52] I—I've been gone for too long
[01:56.04] On my mind, you hit me so strong
[02:00.98] All of these nights feel so long
[02:06.25] But I stay in this state
[02:11.54] Of 12065 away
[02:18.04] 
[02:38.60] I—I've been gone for too long
[02:43.90] On my mind, you hit me so strong
[02:49.22] All of these nights feel so long
[02:54.28] But I stay in this state
[02:59.36] Of 12065 away
